# Minematics - Minecraft-Themed Math Game

Minematics is an engaging math game designed for children to practice their addition skills. Set in a Minecraft-themed world, the game challenges players with math problems while adding a fun, interactive twist. Players must solve addition questions to defeat zombies and keep progressing through the game.

## Game Overview

The game features two exciting modes:

### 1. **Campaign Mode**
- In Campaign Mode, the player needs to answer 30 math questions to win.
- Every 5th question is a "bonus level," where the question must be typed out instead of selected from multiple choices.
- As the player progresses, the questions get harder, and the zombies get faster!

### 2. **Infinity Mode**
- In Infinity Mode, players compete against their own high score to break their personal record.
- Players answer as many math questions as they can before the zombie catches up with them.

### Game Mechanics
- The game displays an addition question along with four multiple-choice answers.
- A zombie is constantly approaching the player. If the zombie reaches the player before they answer the question, they lose.
- As the game progresses, the difficulty of the questions increases, and the zombie's speed increases as well.
- Every 5th question is a "bonus level," where players must type the answer, providing an extra challenge.

### Help Page
- The game includes a help page that explains its mechanics and provides instructions on how to play.
